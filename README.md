# IsaacRemoteConsole
Remotely call console commands in Afterbirth+.

## How to use:
1. Clone repo or download as zip
2. Open in VS (I used 2015)
3. Make sure you have MFC tools installed, this was created using it
4. Build as x86
5. Use any DLL injector to inject the DLL into isaac-ng once Isaac is running
6. The UI should pop up and you can execute commands

## Bugs:
* spawned items/monsters/achievements don't have sprites until you exit the run and continue
* some commands won't work (stage command seems to be broken)
* probably some other stuff
